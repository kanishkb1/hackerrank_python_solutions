Problem-1

Here is a sample line of code that can be executed in Python:

print("Hello, World!")
You can just as easily store a string as a variable and then print it to stdout:

my_string = "Hello, World!"
print(my_string)
The above code will print Hello, World! on your screen. Try it yourself in the editor below!

Input Format

You do not need to read any input in this challenge.

Output Format

Print Hello, World! to stdout.

Sample Output 0

Hello, World!

print("Hello, World!")

Problem-2
Task
Given an integer, , perform the following conditional actions:

If  is odd, print Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Not Weird
If  is even and in the inclusive range of  to , print Weird
If  is even and greater than , print Not Weird
Input Format

A single line containing a positive integer, .

Constraints

Output Format

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

Sample Input 0

3
Sample Output 0

Weird
Explanation 0


 is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.

Sample Input 1

24
Sample Output 1

Not Weird
Explanation 1


 and  is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

Problem-3
Task
Read two integers and print two lines. The first line should contain integer division,  // . The second line should contain float division,  / .

You don't need to perform any rounding or formatting operations.

Input Format

The first line contains the first integer, . The second line contains the second integer, .

Output Format

Print the two lines as described above.

Problem-5

We add a Leap Day on February 29, almost every four years. The leap day is an extra, or intercalary day and we add it to the shortest month of the year, February.
In the Gregorian calendar three criteria must be taken into account to identify leap years:

The year can be evenly divided by 4, is a leap year, unless:
The year can be evenly divided by 100, it is NOT a leap year, unless:
The year is also evenly divisible by 400. Then it is a leap year.
This means that in the Gregorian calendar, the years 2000 and 2400 are leap years, while 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300 and 2500 are NOT leap years.Source

Task
You are given the year, and you have to write a function to check if the year is leap or not.

Note that you have to complete the function and remaining code is given as template.

Input Format

Read y, the year that needs to be checked.

Constraints


Output Format

Output is taken care of by the template. Your function must return a boolean value (True/False)

Sample Input 0

1990
Sample Output 0

False
Explanation 0

1990 is not a multiple of 4 hence it's not a leap year.
*************
def is_leap(year):
    return year % 4 == 0 and (year % 400 == 0 or year % 100 != 0)

year = int(input())

Problem-6

Read an integer .

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:


Note that "" represents the values in between.

Input Format
